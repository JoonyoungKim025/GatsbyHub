# About

GatsbyHub is an [open-source](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/GatsbyHub) extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that offers an interactive GUI for [Gatsby-cli](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli).

GatsbyHub gives you the ability to browse [Gatsby plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/), starters, and themes without ever having to leave VS Code. Create a blazing fast, modern app with a single click or check out the many [Gatsby starter templates](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/?) available. Start a hot-reloading development environment by simply clicking the status bar icon and configure GraphQL queries using Gatsby's built-in instance of GraphiQL. For advanced customizations, refer to the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-cli/) and edit your [user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings).
